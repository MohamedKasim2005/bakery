Don Bosco, also known as Saint John Bosco, dedicated his life to the education and <br>well-being of impoverished and neglected youth, particularly street children. He <br>developed a unique educational approach, the Salesian Preventive System, based on <br>reason, religion, and loving-kindness, emphasizing building positive relationships <br>with students. Don Bosco's work extended to creating schools, orphanages, and youth <br>centers, ultimately founding the Salesian religious order to continue his mission.</b></h3>
